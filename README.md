# Pacman

This is a project that I assigned myself and was able to finish in about two and a half weeks.
As the title suggests, it's a program to play pacman - it's got bonus food that when eaten allows pacman to eat the ghosts and all that stuff.

I used the JavaFX API and at the time I worked on this build, I didn't know how to work with images so I used a circle to represent pacman and triangles to represent the ghosts.
The user controls pacman using the arrow keys. I created walls using squares and checked for collision using the coordinates of the walls and pacman. Pretty simple.
